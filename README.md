# Setting Up a New Python Project 


Set up your working folders. 

 

Start by creating a 'repos' folder at the root of your C: drive to avoid an file path limits (255 chars in Windows!) and conflicts with OenDrive. 

 

Next create a folder for your DGT projects called '11DGT'  

 

Finally,  create a folder for your project called 'flask-demo' and open it in VS Code. 

 

Now, you need to create a virtual environment. 

 

Open a terminal and type. 

 
```bash
python -m venv .venv 
``` 

 

This creates a .venv folder inside the project. That folder contains a separate Python environment for this project. 

 

Next, you activate it. 

 

On Windows PowerShell: 

 
```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 
```

 

If the prompt changes to include (.venv), that is evidence that the environment is active. 

 

NB: You might get an error here regarding running PowerShell scripts.  To resolve that run: 
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser 
```
 

Then you upgrade pip: 

 
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip 
```

 

This matters because pip is the tool that installs Python packages. Using python -m pip is clearer than just typing pip, because it makes sure the package installer belongs to the currently selected Python interpreter. 

 

Example package install 

 

If the project later needs a package such as requests, you would install it like this: 

 
```bash
pip install flask 
```
 

Your first flask app 

 

Add an app.py file with the following code: 

 
```python
# app.py 
from flask import Flask 
 

app = Flask(__name__) 
 

@app.route("/") 
def greet(): 
    return "Hello, World!" 
 
```
 

 

How to run it 

 
```bash
flask run
```
